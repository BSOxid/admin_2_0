    This is the OXID Admin 2.0 project.

    It offers a REST interface for administrative tasks in OXID and wants to abstract the gui from the business logic.
    Of course we're implemening a new GUI. But this is just our idea.
    Feel free to add a mobile version, desktop apllication or any other way to administer your shop.
